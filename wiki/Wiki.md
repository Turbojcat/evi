Ticket System
Evi features a comprehensive ticket system to handle user inquiries and support requests. The system includes the following functionalities:

Ticket Creation
Users can create tickets by clicking on the "Create Ticket" button in the ticket panel. The bot will prompt the user for necessary information and create a new ticket channel.

Ticket Management
Staff members can manage tickets using commands such as /ticketclose, /ticketdelete, /ticketadd, /ticketremove, and more. These commands allow staff members to efficiently handle tickets.

Ticket Categories
Server administrators can define custom ticket categories to organize tickets based on topics or departments. Categories can be added or removed using the /ticketcategory command.

Ticket Questions
Server administrators can configure custom questions to be asked to users when they create a ticket. Questions can be added or removed using the /ticketquestion command.

Ticket Responses
When a user responds to a ticket question, the response is recorded, and a summary of the responses is displayed in the ticket channel.

Ticket Transcripts
When a ticket is closed, a transcript of the conversation is generated and sent to a designated channel. Transcripts are automatically deleted after 30 days.

Ticket Statistics
The /ticketstats command displays statistics about the ticket system, including the total number of tickets, open tickets, and closed tickets.

Ticket Feedback
After a ticket is closed, users can provide feedback and rate their experience using the /ticketfeedback command.

Event Handling
Evi utilizes an event-driven architecture to handle various events, such as command interactions, messages, and ticket-related events. Event handlers are organized in separate files within the events directory.

Database Integration
The bot is integrated with a MySQL database to store data such as tickets, users, server settings, and more. The database models are defined in the database/models directory, and the database connection is managed in database/database.js.

Error Handling
Evi incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to catch and log errors that occur during runtime. Errors are logged to the console and reported to the bot owner for debugging purposes.
